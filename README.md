1. Data Processing & Calculating Tornado-induced NDVI Change Magnitude Images

Our data were generated using Google Earth Engine (GEE), and subsequently batch-downloaded for local processing. Links:https://code.earthengine.google.com/6c8dee222d5da45919e9f99a4e679410

To support the validation of our algorithm, we have uploaded three GEE-generated NDVI scenes as representative examplesï¼ˆtornado_1000_15_13;tornado_1000_15_65;tornado_1000_15_101)
