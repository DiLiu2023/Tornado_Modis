Our data were generated using Google Earth Engine (GEE), and subsequently batch-downloaded for local processing. To support the validation of our algorithm, we have uploaded three GEE-generated NDVI scenes as representative examples（tornado_1000_15_13.tif;tornado_1000_15_65.tif;tornado_1000_15_101.tif）.
