1.  Data Processing & Calculating Tornado-induced NDVI Change Magnitude Images
Our data were generated using Google Earth Engine (GEE), and subsequently batch-downloaded for local processing. Links：https://code.earthengine.google.com/4ff2abec9c6b4284ec69d37986936beb
To support the validation of our algorithm, we have uploaded three GEE-generated NDVI scenes as representative examples（tornado_1000_15_13.tif;tornado_1000_15_65.tif;tornado_1000_15_101.tif) tornado_1000_15_13-> Buffer=1000M  day=15day Tornado_Number=13
